# Keka_Task_ToDo
ToDo list application using Android Studio, SQLite, Java
Set Up Project:

Create a new Android Studio project.
Set up your project structure with necessary folders (e.g., model, database, adapter, activity).
Design the Database:

Create a SQLite database helper class to manage the database creation and version management.
Define a contract class to specify the structure of your database, including table names, column names, and queries.
Create Task Model:

Create a simple Java class (Task) to represent a task with attributes like title, description, and an ID.
UI Layout:

Design the UI layout for your tasks using XML in the res/layout folder.
Include elements like RecyclerView to display tasks, EditText for input, and buttons for actions.
Create TaskAdapter:

Build a RecyclerView adapter (TaskAdapter) to bind data to the UI.
Implement a custom ViewHolder for efficient item updates.
Implement Database Operations:

In the database helper class, implement methods for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving tasks.
TaskDAO (Data Access Object):

Create a TaskDAO class to encapsulate the database operations related to tasks.
TaskRepository:

Develop a TaskRepository class to act as an intermediary between the ViewModel and the data source (DAO).
ViewModel:

Create a ViewModel to manage UI-related data, handle user interactions, and communicate with the repository.
Wire it Together:

In the main activity, instantiate the ViewModel and set up observers to update the UI based on changes in the data.
Handle User Input:

Implement functionality to add, edit, and delete tasks in response to user input.
Testing:

Test your application to ensure that tasks are stored/retrieved correctly and that the UI responds appropriately to user actions.
